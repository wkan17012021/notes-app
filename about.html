      <h3>Simulating web app install</h3>
      <p>
        If viewing this app on a smartphone browser, navigate to home screen,
        then tap on your browser settings. Look for an option to install app -
        screenshot for guidance below.

      />
      <h3>Manifest JSON file</h3>
      <p>
        This is a single json file which provides metadata about our application
        to the browser. The manifest file for this app includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the naming</li>
        <li>
          the url that should load when the user clicks or taps the icon to open
          the app
        </li>
        <li>
          the display type which can be set to browser, if you want the app to
          open in a users preferred browser. Otherwise, set to standalone which
          will load natively like a mobile app
        </li>
        <li>
          Background color which will be shown when the app loads (splash
          screen)
        </li>
        <li>Icons array to load appropriately for different devices</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Service Workers (SWs)</h3>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most crucial component to a PWA. These javascript files
        allow for loading content when offline. When the user interacts when
        offline, the result is computed once they get online again, known as
        background sync. SWs allow for push notifications - notifications on new
        content, messages, updated content etc.
      </p>
      <h4>How do SWs operate?</h4>
      <p>
        Traditionally, JS files are tightly coupled with the DOM along a single
        thread when requested by a web browser. SWs however, run on an isolated
        thread in the background and do not have access to the DOM. SWs can
        remain active on a mobile device even when the browser tab or app has
        been closed. Their job is to listen to events and fire fetch requests
        and push messages or notifications when the event is triggered.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to consider for deployment, that SWs only work on pages
        that have been served on HTTPS connection. This is because SWs can
        intercept requests sent by the browser so they need to be secure.
        Localhost however is an exception for development ease.
      </p>
      <h4>SW Lifecyle</h4>
      <p>
        SW files are typically placed in the project root so they can have
        global scope of the project i.e. it has access to any files which it may
        need through its lifecycle. The first step is to register the file, you
        can do this through a separate javascript file e.g. app.js. When this
        happens, the install event gets fired when the browser parses this line
        of code. This is a useful first step, as we can then perform some
        functionality like cache media assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once registered and installed, the SW becomes active and an active event
        is triggered where the SW 'listens' for global events in the app.
      </p>
      <h3>Altering the SW Code</h3>
      <p>
        If the code changes, the next time the page is refreshed, the new SW
        file will be registered and installed but remains
        <strong>in waiting</strong> i.e. not active. This is because the old SW
        code is still active and performing functionality. We need to wait until
        the old SW completes its lifecycle, then it will be swapped out for the
        in waiting new SW. Typically, the transition from old to new SW code
        happens when the app is refreshed or closed to reduce disturbance.
      </p>
      <h3>Retreiving data from the database with a PWA</h3>
      <p>
        The approach will differ depending on what database solution you
        implement. Most likely, the IndexedDB API found in dev tools application
        tab, is commonly used as a temporary store before it is uploaded to the
        server or as a client-side cache.
